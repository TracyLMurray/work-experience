1. ok, thank you, you have cleaned up and condensed all of the past work experience examples. Now using all of those examples, can you create a summary for a resume of a Chief Architect?

2. That was perfect, thank you. Now that you know so much about me I would like to work on my resume. I will provide blocks of experience from my resume in markdown with the following form

## Title
### Company and Area
### Timeline
* Experience 1
* Experience 2
* Experience 3

3. Here is the first example. I simply want you to read it using the format I provided and I will ask you questions to see if you understand it before we continue.

## Chief Solutions Architect
### 3M: Corporate Research
### Fall 2017 - Winter 2021
* Chief Solutions Architect for three top corporate wide initiatives related to informatics, multimodal communication, and factory automation

4. What in your opinion was the most impactful contribution I made during this role?
5. That is a great summary, thank you. Can you restate it as a summary I can use in my resume?
6. Well done. Next I would like to provide you additional experience and have you output similar paragraphs for each example. Does this make sense?
7. No, the paragraph form of response you provided 4 responses ago starting with your response "Certainly! Here's a restated summary you can use in your resume". I would like this to be output in that form.
8. That is a better summary paragraph, but it is in first person and I would like it in third person.
9. Try again but please don't refer to me as "the candidate", this will be leveraged as a summary on LinkedIn where I have not yet applied to a job.
10. Again, the tone is wrong. Please regenerate it but use the same tone as your previous summary which follows:

Proven Chief Solutions Architect with a track record of driving digital transformation and operational efficiency across global organizations. Recognized as an internal IoT and edge expert, leading strategic initiatives in informatics, multimodal communication, and factory automation. Spearheaded the adoption of secure solutions, policy changes, and trade secret developments for remote workforce enablement. Pioneered the release of the first corporate platform on public 3M GitHub, fostering open-source collaboration and innovation. Provided technical leadership and mentorship to software engineering and DevOps teams. Highly regarded for executive-level presentations and speaking engagements on IoT, digital product development, and architecture. Notable contributions include leading the 3M corporate hackathon with over 1000 participants worldwide and playing a key role in sustainable stockpile management and clinical supply chain sustainability partnerships. Adept at conducting architecture reviews to support large-scale corporate acquisitions.
11. Ok, now that you understand the tone and summary format, I would like to provide you more examples and have you leverage the tone and format to output additional summaries.
12. ok, thank you. Now that you understand both my contributions and work experience do you think you would be able to generate a resume for me?
13.
