# Architecture

- **Project: Digital Factory**
  - Successfully advocated for cloud adoption despite initial resistance, educating stakeholders on cloud benefits and discouraging custom-built solutions (NIH).
  - Played a pivotal role in architecting and supporting proof-of-concept (POC) efforts with both AWS and Microsoft.
  - Led discussions and facilitated the migration of data from historians to the cloud, enhancing data management and analysis capabilities.
  - Collaborated with Rockwell Automation to align their product roadmap with the digital factory initiative, ensuring seamless integration.
  - Developed comprehensive data movement strategies for hot, warm, and cold data use cases, optimizing data utilization within the organization.
- **KCI / Acelity**
  - **Business Review:**
    - Implemented wound color classification and identified opportunities for wound boundary identification, contributing to JIT manufacturing efforts and deploying the algorithm to 3 research projects.
  - **Architecture Review:**
    - Streamlined onboarding and 3M security review process, reducing onboarding time from 3 months to 1 month.
    - Optimized IoT data movement, resulting in approximately $200/month payload savings.
  - Supported onboarding during the 3M acquisition process.
  - Developed IoT connectivity solution for remote wound care device.
- **LeanTec Acquisition**
  - Conducted architecture evaluation for senior leaders, leveraging the 12-factor methodology.
  - Contributed to successful acquisition, creating a roadmap of improvements and providing comprehensive reports.
- **Material Informatics**
  - Designed API strategy, implemented custom file ingest, and decomposed monolithic architecture.
- **MX**
  - **Architecture:**
    - Implemented cloud infrastructure POC and provided education on cloud, IoT, and edge technologies.
    - Consolidated ideas, filed patents, and created data flow for model development.
  - **Multiple Division Application:**
    - **Digital Factory:**
      - Archived for future internal "in the dark" manufacturing efforts.
    - **Connected Safety:**
      - Transferred and leveraged architecture pattern for multiple projects.
  - Predicted $500M impact (based on projected sales in a $4.3B market) and collaborated with a global team.
- **Process Informatics**
  - **Zero Touch:**
    - Evaluated and brought in cost-effective vendors, educated stakeholders on cloud-to-edge device updates.
  - **Azure to AWS Migration:**
    - Adopted agnostic replacements, enabling incremental migration and leveraging Azure IoT common Docker.
  - Ongoing deployment progress in edge manufacturing architecture.

# Bluebird

- **Combine 7 Existing Processes**
  - Streamlined and consolidated 7 processes, reducing request timelines and processing time from 6 months to 2 weeks.
- **Plan Trip**
  - Locked in a room for a week, traveled to Redmond, and collaborated with managers in TTS/ISRC.
  - Built 90% functional system, discussed policies/roles, DevOps/release tooling, and subscription structure.
  - System heavily used, supports 60+ active projects, and builds trust in the 3M network.
