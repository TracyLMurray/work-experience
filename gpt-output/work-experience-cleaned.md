# Architecture

- **Project: Digital Factory**
  - Overcame significant resistance to the implementation of the program, emphasizing the benefits of cloud technology and cost-effectiveness:
    - Educated stakeholders on the advantages of utilizing cloud services and the disadvantages of building custom solutions (NIH).
    - Despite the pandemic-related challenges, facilitated discussions and ensured the framework was adopted by various teams.
    - Provided architecture support for multiple proof-of-concept (POC) efforts by both AWS and Microsoft.
  - Led discussions and spearheaded the migration of data from historians to the cloud, enabling better data management and analysis capabilities.
  - Actively participated in a year-long committee to establish a new digital manufacturing operations group, contributing to the creation of a comprehensive strategy.
  - Collaborated with Rockwell Automation to align their product roadmap with the requirements of the digital factory initiative.
  - Developed data movement strategies for different data usage scenarios, including hot, warm, and cold data.
- **KCI / Acelity**
  - **Business Review:**
    - Implemented wound color classification and identified opportunities for wound boundary identification.
      - Contributed to JIT manufacturing efforts and deployed to 3 research projects.
      - Established a project team and deployed wound condition and boundary detection algorithm to the business.
  - **Architecture Review:**
    - Provided suggestions to streamline onboarding and 3M security review process.
      - Reduced onboarding time from 3 months to 1 month.
    - Optimized IoT data movement, resulting in approximately $200/month payload savings.
  - Assisted with onboarding support during the 3M acquisition process.
  - Developed IoT connectivity solution for remote wound care device.
- **LeanTec Acquisition**
  - Conducted architecture evaluation at the request of senior leaders under NDA.
  - Dedicated 3 days to review LeanTec's infrastructure and code.
  - Utilized the 12-factor methodology to evaluate systems.
    - Used the evaluation as an example of implementing the 12-factor approach in CBG to enhance quality.
    - Contributed to successful acquisition of LeanTec.
    - Developed a roadmap of improvements and provided team sizing/estimates.
    - Created a comprehensive report utilized by the division and M&A teams.
- **Material Informatics**
  - Developed an API strategy to enhance data integration and accessibility.
  - Implemented custom file ingest capabilities for seamless data ingestion.
  - Decomposed the monolithic architecture into modular components, improving scalability and maintainability.
- **MX**
  - **Architecture:**
    - Implemented cloud infrastructure proof of concept (POC) and provided education on cloud, IoT, and edge technologies to the team and stakeholders.
    - Created data flow for various communication channels to support model development.
    - Consolidated ideas into a single set of diagrams and filed 2 individual and 3 team information systems (IS).
      - Filed 1 individual and 2 team patents globally, including capturing communication information through a mesh network.
  - **Multiple Division Application:**
    - **Digital Factory:**
      - Archived for future internal "in the dark" manufacturing efforts.
    - **Connected Safety:**
      - Transferred and leveraged architecture pattern for several projects.
  - Predicted $500M impact once commercialized (based on a $4.3B market and projected sales).
  - Collaborated with a global team.
- **Process Informatics**
  - **Zero Touch:**
    - Evaluated outpost/snow device options, brought in vendor (Zededa), and explored EKS/ECS Anywhere as cost-effective alternatives.
    - Educated stakeholders on updating edge devices from the cloud, overcoming internal politics within the team.
  - **Azure to AWS Migration:**
    - Adopted agnostic replacements for Azure-specific services, such as using Kafka instead of Event Hub, Min.IO instead of blob storage, and Influx as an upstream match for SQL.
    - Enabled incremental migration with agnostic solutions, allowing for ongoing work and progress.
    - Leveraged GGv2 as Azure IoT common Docker.
  - **Edge Manufacturing Architecture**
    - Ongoing deployment progress with 3 lines already deployed and plans for 5 more in 2022/2023.

# Bluebird

- **Combine 7 Existing Processes**
  - Streamlined and consolidated multiple processes into a unified workflow.
  - Reduced the following requests and timelines:
    - 1 tooling request
    - 2 AAD (Azure Active Directory) requests for tooling and Azure
    - 4 subscription requests
  - Achieved a significant reduction in processing time, reducing the overall timeline from 6 months to 2 weeks.
- **Plan Trip**
  - Locked in a room for a week to focus on trip planning.
  - Traveled to Redmond and collaborated with managers in TTS (Technology and Tools for Services) and ISRC (Intelligent Systems Research Center).
  - Built out automation and returned with a 90% functional system.
  - Discussed topics such as policies/roles, DevOps/release tooling, and subscription structure.
  - System still heavily in use and has contributed to building a large 3M network of trust.
  - Adaptable as a "close to core" solution and currently supports over 60 active projects.
