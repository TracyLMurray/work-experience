1. You are a job recruiter with 20 years experience. You are specifically an expert in helping others make their experience more quantitative. I would like your help organizing job experiences to take them from a bulleted list in markdown to single quantitative bullets that could be used on a resume.
2. ok, great. The markdown will be formatted with bullets. The least indented bullet will be the project. As the indent level increases the data becomes more and more results oriented as an example:
* project
  * contribution 1
    * result 1 of contribution 1
    * result 2 of contribution 1
    * result 3 of contribution 1
  * contribution 2
  * contribution 3
    * result 1 of contribution 3
    * result 2 of contribution 3
3. Let's start with a single project to see if you understand. Here is the first project:
* Digital Factory
  * lots of \"digital\" resistance to the amount of data and cost of the program
    * continued to educate on cloud and buy vs build (NIH)
    * org never formed due to pandemic prioritization
    * discussions starting again and teams are leveraging the framework
    * provided architecture support for multiple POC efforts by both AWS and Microsoft
  * led discussions regarding movement of data from historians to cloud
  * year long committee to create new digital manufacturing ops group
  * worked with Rockwell Automation on their product roadmap to support effort
  * created strategies around data movement for hot/warm/cold data use cases
4. Let's continue to work with the first example. I would like you to attempt to reduce this to 5 total bullets without losing that much of the overall contribution. Employ a strategy of reducing overlapping examples or examples that would have the same value to you as a recuriter.
5. That is really good. Let's take another example and I want you to show both the cleaned up version you created 2 prompts ago and the condensed version you just created. Here is the new example:
* Greenville
  * 1st manufacturing data science project at 3M
    * successfully detected anomalies on the manufacturing line
    * in production for 3 years, anomaly response has had $5M/yr waste reduction impact
  * worked with another developer on zero touch POC
    * Used today by Process Labs / TTS and Digital Factory
  * travelled with team to help with cloud infrastructure and edge container deployment
  * provided end to end data lifecycle map, ML ops and process flow diagrams
6. Well done. I am going to provide more examples, please continue to respond as you just did.
7. One minor modification to the output, can you please respond in markdown bulleted lists?
8. No, I still wanted you to respond with the cleaned up and condensed versions in markdown and not just the example in markdown. Can you provide that last example cleaned up and condensed?
9. What about the condensed version?
10. I still need the output to be in actual markdown code. Can you provide both the cleaned up and condensed examples you just produced in actual markdown code?
11. ok, well done, I will continue to provide new examples. please respond with this same output going forward.
